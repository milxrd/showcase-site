# Showcase site

**This project is a showcase website template with a blog feature.**
* Next.js framework provides routing.
* Tailwind CSS provides styling with custom theme.
* Notion is used as CMS and database for the blog tab.
* The data and contents are structured with Contentlayer and transformed into the markdown files.
* I have learned the containerization concepts using Docker.
* The app contains server side error handlers, e2e and component tests in Cypress.
